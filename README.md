# Ball tracking in a Volleyball environment üèê

## Introduction

This repository contains the code, the final report and the presentation for project of the course "Signal, Image &amp; Video" - MSc in Artificial Intelligence Systems - University of Trento. 

The aim of the project is to achieve the ball tracking in a volleyball scenario without the use of state of the art deep learning architectures.

The project is developed by [@lorenzialessandro](https://github.com/lorenzialessandro) and [@LuCazzola](https://github.com/LuCazzola).

````
2. Start the notebook server
````
jupyter notebook
````
3. Open the notebook project file
````
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
````
4. Follow the file steps in order to run the notebook python code

If you want to execute the notebook from your terminal use the ``execute`` subcommand:

## YOLOv5 comparison

A Yolov5 object detector has been trained on the same task and dataset. To see it's perfermances :

1. Download locally Yolov5 repo and requrements
````
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
````
2. Run detection
````
python3 detect.py --weights ../YOLOv5_weights.pt --view-img --conf-thres 0.5  --source ../videos/vid3-cut.mp4
````
